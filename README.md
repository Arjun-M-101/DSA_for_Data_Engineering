# DSA for Data Engineering 🚀

This repository is my personal practice ground for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** with a focus on **Data Engineering interview prep**.  
I’m selectively using problems from **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet** as a guide, but tailoring the journey to my own learning path.

## 📌 Current Progress
✅ Step 01 – Basics  
✅ Step 02 – Sorting Techniques  
✅ Step 03 – Arrays  
✅ Step 04 – Binary Search  
✅ Step 05 – Strings  
✅ Step 07 – Recursion  
✅ Step 10 – Sliding Window & Two Pointer
✅ Step 12 – Greedy Algorithm  

🔄 Currently finished till **Arrays**, continuing step by step.

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen core DSA concepts for Data Engineering interviews  
- Practice problems from brute force → optimal → clear explanation  
- Improve step‑by‑step problem solving
- Connect DSA patterns to real Data Engineering use cases
