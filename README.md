# DSA for Data Engineering 🚀

This repository is my personal practice ground for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** with a focus on **Data Engineering interview prep**.  
I’m selectively using problems from **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet** as a guide, but tailoring the journey to my own learning path.

## 📌 Current Progress
✅ Step 01 – Basics  
✅ Step 02 – Sorting Techniques  
✅ Step 03 – Arrays  
✅ Step 04 – Binary Search  
✅ Step 05 – Strings  
✅ Step 07 – Recursion  
✅ Step 10 – Sliding Window  
✅ Step 12 – Greedy Algorithm  

🔄 Currently finished till **Arrays**, continuing step by step.

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen **core DSA concepts** relevant for Data Engineering interviews  
- Practice **brute force → optimize → explain** approach  
- Build confidence in **explaining solutions step by step**  
- Map DSA patterns to **real-world Data Engineering problems** (e.g., prefix sums → ETL aggregations, sliding window → stream processing)
